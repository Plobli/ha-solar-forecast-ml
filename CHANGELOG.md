## [3.0.6] - 2025-10-19

### 🎉 Complete ML Fix Release

This release combines all critical bugfixes from v3.0.3 through v3.0.6 into one stable release. After extensive testing, Solar Forecast ML now works exactly as designed with reliable machine learning, data persistence, and accurate forecasting.

**⚠️ All users on v3.0.2 or earlier should update immediately!**

---

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

#### Bug #1: Manual Forecast Button Data Loss (v3.0.3)

**Problem:** Pressing the manual forecast button caused complete loss of historical data, breaking machine learning functionality.

**Root Cause:** The button's `async_press()` method called `_create_forecast()` without first loading historical data from disk, causing incomplete data to be saved back.

**Fix:** Added history loading before forecast creation in `button.py`:
```python
async def async_press(self):
    await self.coordinator._load_history()  # Load first!
    await self.coordinator._create_forecast()
```

**Impact:** Manual forecast button now preserves all historical data correctly.

---

#### Bug #2: Hourly Data Overwrite (v3.0.4)

**Problem:** Newly collected hourly generation data overwrote all previously collected hours instead of merging.

**Root Cause:** Used `copy()` instead of `update()` when saving hourly data in two locations:
- `_collect_hourly_data()` - immediate save after collection
- `_create_forecast()` - forecast update

**Fix:** Changed to merge operation in `sensor.py`:
```python
# Before (overwrites all hours):
self.daily_predictions[today]['hourly_data'] = self.today_hourly_data.copy()

# After (merges with existing hours):
if 'hourly_data' not in self.daily_predictions[today]:
    self.daily_predictions[today]['hourly_data'] = {}
self.daily_predictions[today]['hourly_data'].update(self.today_hourly_data)
```

**Impact:** Complete daily generation profiles are now maintained correctly.

---

#### Bug #3: Hourly Data Loss on Restart (v3.0.4)

**Problem:** Hourly data collected between 06:00 and 23:00 was lost on Home Assistant restart because it was only stored in RAM.

**Root Cause:** Hourly data was only written to disk at 06:00 (morning forecast) and 23:00 (learning cycle).

**Fix:** Implemented immediate disk save after each hourly collection in `sensor.py`:
```python
# After collecting hour data:
self.daily_predictions[today]['hourly_data'].update(self.today_hourly_data)
self._save_history()  # Save immediately to disk!
```

**Impact:** Hourly data now survives restarts at any time, improving ML accuracy.

---

#### Bug #4: Weather Integration Detection Failure (v3.0.5)

**Problem:** Race condition during Home Assistant startup - Solar Forecast ML tried to detect weather integration before it was ready, causing "No forecast method available" errors.

**Root Cause:** Weather integrations load after custom components, causing detection to fail during startup.

**Fix:** Implemented lazy detection with retry mechanism in `sensor.py`:
- Detection only happens on first actual forecast request (not during startup)
- 3 retry attempts with progressive delays (0s, 2s, 5s)
- Robust handling of weather integration startup delays

**Impact:** Integration now reliably detects weather method even after restarts.

### ✨ Enhancements

#### Optimized Status Display (v3.0.6)

**Problem:** Status sensor displayed too much information, making it hard to read at a glance.

**Before:**
```
Runs normal | Last Forecast: 0.0h ago | Next Learning: 6h | Inverter: Not configured | Accuracy: 0% | Weather: GENERIC (Service) | Profile: Not available
```

**After:**
```
Forecast: 0.0h ago | Learning in: 6h | 0%
```

**Smart Display Logic:**
- Shows only essential information by default
- Inverter status only when configured
- Profile status only when data available
- Warning emoji (⚠️) when inverter offline or forecast stale (>6h)

**Impact:** Cleaner, more readable status at a glance.

---

### 📝 Documentation Improvements

- Completely redesigned README with modern structure
- Added visual learning timeline with ASCII art
- Expanded configuration guide with sensor impact metrics
- Added best practices section with automation examples
- Improved balance between technical details and user-friendly content
- Enhanced troubleshooting section with common issues
- Better organization for improved scanability

---

### 🔧 Technical Details

**Changed Files:**
- `sensor.py` - Multiple critical fixes for data persistence and weather detection
- `button.py` - History loading before forecast creation
- `manifest.json` - Version 3.0.6
- `README.md` - Complete documentation overhaul
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Comprehensive changelog

**Performance Impact:**
- Minimal overhead: ~20 additional disk writes per day (hourly saves)
- Improved reliability: Data survives restarts at any time
- Better ML accuracy: Complete daily generation profiles maintained
- Faster startup: Lazy weather detection eliminates race conditions

---

### 🔄 Migration Notes

**From v3.0.2 or earlier:**
- No breaking changes
- No configuration changes needed
- Historical data will be preserved going forward
- Data lost before this update cannot be recovered

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Update via HACS or manually download release
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Verify historical data preservation in logs
4. Continue normal operation - ML will improve accuracy over 2-4 weeks
