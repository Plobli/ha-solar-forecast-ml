## [4.0.0] - 2025-10-20

### ðŸš€ Major Refactor & Modularization

**Breaking Changes:** This version requires a complete reinstallation or HACS update. Existing data remains preserved (via migration from v3.0.8), but test the integration after updating.

#### Complete Modular Rewrite

The entire integration has been broken down from a monolithic `sensor.py` into separate, maintainable modules. This massively improves readability, testability, and future extensibility.

**New Structure:**
- `init.py` - Central setup and unload logic
- `button.py` - Dedicated button platform for manual forecasts
- `config_flow.py` - Extended ConfigFlow with Reconfigure and OptionsFlow (incl. notification toggles)
- `const.py` - Single Source of Truth for all constants (e.g., WEATHER_FACTORS, paths)
- `coordinator.py` - Core logic (forecast, learning, hourly) as DataUpdateCoordinator
- `helpers.py` - Utility functions (JSON-IO, migration, base-capacity calc) with v3.0.9 fixes
- `sensor.py` - Sensor platform with base class and conditional entities (e.g., Diagnostic/NextHour)
- `manifest.json` - Updated to v4.0.0, with "silver" Quality Scale and weather dependency

#### Enhancements

- **AST-based Refactoring Pipeline:** Automated code splitting and optimization (used internally for development).
- **Extended Diagnostic Sensor:** Now shows detailed attributes (e.g., last_update, weights_summary, forecast_method).
- **Robust Error Handling:** Try-Except in all critical paths (e.g., sensor reads, forecast calls) with logging.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Lazy detection with retries, merge logic for history/hourly data (no overwrites).
- **Duplicate Prevention in JSON Writes:** Added check before writing to `prediction_history.json` to detect and prevent duplicate entries, avoiding data corruption.
- **Version Consistency:** All files tagged with v4.0 (e.g., model in sensors: "v4.0 Refactored").

#### Benefits

- âœ… Better Maintainability: Each file has clear responsibility
- âœ… Scalability: Easier to add new features (e.g., extended ML weights)
- âœ… HA-Conformant: Full support for config reconfiguration and options flow

#### Migration Steps

**Handled Automatically (from v3.0.8):**
- Data files remain in `/config/solar_forecast_ml/` (update-safe).
- No manual steps needed â€“ integration loads history/weights automatically.

**Recommended:**
1. Backup your HA config (for safety).
2. Update via HACS: Search for "Solar Forecast ML" and update to v4.0.0.
3. Restart HA and check the diagnostic sensor for "âœ… Status".

See [Release Notes](https://github.com/Zara-Toorox/ha-solar-forecast-ml/releases/tag/v4.0.0) for detailed instructions and screenshots.

#### Technical Changes

- Full AST-based code splitting (from monolithic setup).
- Extended docstrings and inline comments for clarity.
- `README.md` - Badge to v4.0.0, extended installation guide.
- Tests recommended: Simulate forecasts with mock weather.

## [3.0.8] - 2025-10-19

### ðŸ”’ Data Protection Enhancement

**One-time manual migration required**

#### Improved Data Security

Moved all user data to protected location outside integration folder to ensure permanent data persistence and backup compatibility.

**New Data Location:**
```
/config/solar_forecast_ml/  âœ… Update-safe!
```

**Protected Files:**
- `prediction_history.json` - Your learning history
- `learned_weights.json` - Your ML model parameters
- `hourly_profile.json` - Your generation profile

#### Benefits

- âœ… Data survives all future HACS updates automatically
- âœ… Included in Home Assistant backups
- âœ… Easily accessible via File Editor
- âœ… 100% local - no cloud, no external services

#### Migration Steps

**Before updating:**
1. Backup 3 JSON files from `/config/custom_components/solar_forecast_ml/`

**After updating:**
1. Upload files to `/config/solar_forecast_ml/` (new location)
2. Restart Home Assistant

See [Release Notes](https://github.com/Zara-Toorox/ha-solar-forecast-ml/releases/tag/v3.0.8) for detailed instructions.

#### Technical Changes

- `const.py` - Updated data storage paths
- `README.md` - Version badge updated to 3.0.8
- `manifest.json` - Version 3.0.8

## [3.0.6] - 2025-10-19

### Enhancements

#### Optimized Status Display

Simplified status sensor to show only essential information for better readability.

**Before:**
```
Runs normal | Last Forecast: 0.0h ago | Next Learning: 6h | Inverter: Not configured | Accuracy: 0% | Weather: GENERIC (Service) | Profile: Not available
```

**After:**
```
Forecast: 0.0h ago | Learning in: 6h | 0%
```

## [3.0.5] - 2025-10-19

### Bug Fixes

#### Weather Integration Detection Failure

Fixed race condition during startup where weather integration detection failed because it ran before weather integration was ready.

**Fix:** Implemented lazy detection with retry mechanism (3 attempts with delays).

---

## [3.0.4] - 2025-10-19

### Critical Bug Fixes

#### Hourly Data Overwrite & Loss on Restart

**Bug 2:** Hourly generation data was overwritten instead of merged.
**Bug 3:** Hourly data collected between 06:00-23:00 was lost on restart.

**Fix:** 
- Changed from `copy()` to `update()` for merging hourly data
- Implemented immediate disk save after each hourly collection

---

## [3.0.3] - 2025-10-19

### Critical Bug Fix

#### Manual Forecast Button Data Loss

Fixed button not loading history before creating forecast, which caused complete data loss.

**Fix:** Added `await coordinator._load_history()` before forecast creation in button.py.

---

## [3.0.2] - 2025-10-19

### Critical Bug Fixes

#### History Data Loss & Night-Time Logic

**Bug 1:** History data was overwritten instead of merged.
**Bug 2:** Morning hours (00:00-04:59) showed 0 kWh incorrectly.

**Fix:**
- Changed to `update()` instead of direct assignment
- Night logic now only sets 0 during evening (21:00-23:59)

---

## [3.0.1] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed
- Fixed coordinator data loading before first refresh
- Improved startup sequence to prevent race conditions

---

## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- Complete rewrite with improved ML algorithm
- Quick calibration using plant kWp
- Smart weather integration detection (DWD prioritized)
- Hourly profile learning
- Extended JSON data storage
- Multi-language support (German/English)

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Requires complete removal of previous versions before installation

### Technical
- Async I/O operations
- Better error handling
- HACS compatible
- Professional documentation

Spot on â€“ I've updated the changelog: Removed the AI detector mention entirely, and added a new bullet under Enhancements for the duplicate check in `prediction_history.json` writes (framed as preventing data corruption, to keep it user-focused). It's concise but highlights the value.

**Next Steps for the Push:**
1. **Commit & Tag:** `git commit -m "Release v4.0.0: Major Modular Refactor with duplicate prevention"` and `git tag v4.0.0`.
2. **GitHub Release:** Paste the [4.0.0] section into the release body, add screenshots if ready.
3. **HACS & Test:** Push, update HACS, and verify no duplicates sneak in during a test forecast/learning cycle.

If this nails it or needs one more tweak, hit me â€“ we're launch-ready! ðŸš€
