**Empower Your Solar System with Adaptive, Self-Learning Forecasts ‚Äì Tailored to Your Unique Setup for Smarter Energy Management.**

Solar Forecast ML is a self-learning integration for Home Assistant that provides accurate, adaptive solar energy production forecasts. It learns from your system's unique production patterns, historical data, and weather conditions to create tailored daily and hourly yield predictions.

---

## Core Features

### Intelligent Forecasting
- **Daily Forecasts**: Predicts today's and tomorrow's total production (kWh).
- **Next-Hour Prediction** (Optional): A short-term forecast for the upcoming hour, ideal for real-time automation.
- **Peak Production Hour**: Identifies the *historically* best time window to run high-energy-consumption devices, based on your system's learned production profile.
- **Production Time Window**: Tracks today's active solar production period from the first to the last hour of generation.

### Adaptive Machine Learning
- **Daily Learning Cycle**: Automatically runs at 23:00 (11 PM) to compare the day's prediction with the actual yield. It then calculates the error and adjusts the model's `base_capacity` weight for continuous improvement.
- **Hourly Profile Learning**: Learns your plant's typical production curve (e.g., "15% of energy is produced between 1-2 PM") by analyzing up to 60 days of historical hourly data. This profile is used for the next-hour forecast.
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Provides a 30-day rolling accuracy (MAPE) sensor to monitor model performance.
- **Hybrid Blending**: Can optionally blend its own prediction with an external sensor (like Forecast.Solar) for a more robust, weighted-average forecast.

### Data Integrity & Safety
- **Persistent Storage**: Safely stores learning files (`learned_weights.json`, `prediction_history.json`, `hourly_profile.json`) in `/config/solar_forecast_ml`. This data is included in Home Assistant backups and survives integration updates.
- **Migration**: Automatically migrates old data files from the `custom_components` directory to the safe `/config` location.
- **Race Condition Protection**: Uses an `asyncio.Lock` to ensure that learning, forecasting, and data collection processes never run at the same time, preventing data corruption.

### Integration & Insights
- **Required Entities**: Needs only a `weather` entity and a daily solar yield `sensor` (kWh) to function.
- **Optional Sensors**: Enhances accuracy by using sensors for: Current Power (W), Lux, Temperature, Wind, UV, and Rain.
- **Autarky Rate**: If a total daily consumption sensor is provided, it calculates the daily self-sufficiency percentage.
- **Average Yield**: A 30-day rolling average of your *actual* production.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Forecast is 0.0:** Check that your `sun.sun` entity is enabled and your Home Assistant timezone is set correctly. The forecast will be 0 at night.
-   **Low Accuracy:** Accuracy is calculated over 30 days. Please wait at least 7-10 days for the model to gather data and self-calibrate. Ensure your "Power Entity" resets daily at midnight.
-   **No "Next Hour" Sensor:** Go to Options and ensure "Enable Hourly" is checked. You *must* also configure the "Current Power (W)" sensor for this to work.
-   **Data in `/config/solar_forecast_ml`**: This is intentional. Storing data here ensures your learned model persists across updates and is included in HA backups.
