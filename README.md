**Empower Your Solar System with Adaptive, Self-Learning Forecasts – Tailored to Your Unique Setup for Smarter Energy Management.**

Solar Forecast ML is a self-learning integration for Home Assistant that provides accurate, adaptive solar energy production forecasts. It learns from your system's unique production patterns, historical data, and weather conditions to create tailored daily and hourly yield predictions.

## 🚨 Version 5.0.0 - Breaking Changes

**⚠️ CRITICAL: If upgrading from v4.4.6 or older, you MUST completely remove the old version before installing v5.0.0!**

This is a **major architectural overhaul** with a complete restructure from nested directories to a flat structure. A simple update will **NOT work**.

### Quick Migration Guide:

1. **Backup your data** (optional - your learned data in `/config/solar_forecast_ml/` will be preserved)
2. **Completely remove** the old integration folder:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /config/custom_components/solar_forecast_ml
   ```
3. **Install v5.0.0** via HACS or manually (see Installation below)
4. **Restart Home Assistant**


📖 **[Read the full CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)** for detailed migration instructions and new features.

## Core Features

### Intelligent Forecasting
- **Daily Forecasts**: Predicts today's and tomorrow's total production (kWh).
- **Next-Hour Prediction** (Optional): A short-term forecast for the upcoming hour, ideal for real-time automation.
- **Peak Production Hour**: Identifies the *historically* best time window to run high-energy-consumption devices, based on your system's learned production profile.
- **Production Time Window**: Tracks today's active solar production period from the first to the last hour of generation.

### Adaptive Machine Learning
- **Daily Learning Cycle**: Automatically runs at 23:00 (11 PM) to compare the day's prediction with the actual yield. It then calculates the error and adjusts the model's `base_capacity` weight for continuous improvement.
- **Hourly Profile Learning**: Learns your plant's typical production curve (e.g., "15% of energy is produced between 1-2 PM") by analyzing up to 60 days of historical hourly data. This profile is used for the next-hour forecast.
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Provides a 30-day rolling accuracy (MAPE) sensor to monitor model performance.
- **Hybrid Blending**: Can optionally blend its own prediction with an external sensor (like Forecast.Solar) for a more robust, weighted-average forecast.
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Automatically adjusts weather factors based on historical performance.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and handles anomalous data points.

### Data Integrity & Safety
- **Persistent Storage**: Safely stores learning files (`learned_weights.json`, `prediction_history.json`, `hourly_profile.json`) in `/config/solar_forecast_ml`. This data is included in Home Assistant backups and survives integration updates.
- **Atomic Operations**: All file writes use temporary files with automatic rollback on failure - **zero data loss risk**.
- **Automatic Backups**: Creates backup copies before each write operation.
- **Migration**: Automatically migrates old data files from the `custom_components` directory to the safe `/config` location.
- **Race Condition Protection**: Uses `asyncio.Lock` to ensure that learning, forecasting, and data collection processes never run at the same time, preventing data corruption.
- **Corruption Detection**: Validates data structure on every load with automatic recovery.

### Integration & Insights
- **Required Entities**: Needs only a `weather` entity and a daily solar yield `sensor` (kWh) to function.
- **Optional Sensors**: Enhances accuracy by using sensors for: Current Power (W), Lux, Temperature, Wind, UV, and Rain.
- **Autarky Rate**: If a total daily consumption sensor is provided, it calculates the daily self-sufficiency percentage.
- **Average Yield**: A 30-day rolling average of your *actual* production.
- **Diagnostic Status**: Comprehensive status sensor with service health, model metrics, and debug attributes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Forecast is 0.0:**
- Check that your `sun.sun` entity is enabled and your Home Assistant timezone is set correctly.
- The forecast will be 0 at night (this is expected).
- Verify your weather entity is providing data.

**Low Accuracy:**
- Accuracy is calculated over 30 days. Wait at least 7-10 days for calibration.
- Ensure your "Power Entity" resets daily at midnight.
- Check that optional sensors (Lux, Temp, etc.) are providing valid data.
- Review the Status sensor attributes for data quality issues.

**No "Next Hour" Sensor:**
- Go to Options and ensure "Enable Hourly" is checked.
- You **must** configure the "Current Power (W)" sensor for this feature.
- Wait for at least one full day of data collection.

**Integration Won't Load (v5.0.0):**
- Check logs for `ModuleNotFoundError` - this means old subdirectories still exist.
- Completely remove `/config/custom_components/solar_forecast_ml` and reinstall.
- Ensure all 22 .py files are in the main directory (no `strategies/`, `services/`, `calculators/` folders).
- Delete all `__pycache__` directories and restart HA.

**Sensors Show "Unavailable":**
- Check that the weather entity and power entity are valid and working.
- Wait 5 minutes for the first update cycle.
- Check logs for specific error messages.
- Use the manual forecast button to trigger an immediate update.

**Data Loss Concerns:**
- Data in `/config/solar_forecast_ml/` is intentional and safe.
- This directory is included in Home Assistant backups.
- Data survives integration updates and restarts.
- Never delete this directory unless you want to reset the model.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.solar_forecast_ml: debug
```

Then check **Settings > System > Logs** and filter for "solar_forecast_ml".

---

## Data Files

All learned data is stored in `/config/solar_forecast_ml/`:

| File | Purpose | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `learned_weights.json` | ML model weights (adaptive learning) | ~2 KB |
| `prediction_history.json` | Last 365 days of forecasts vs. actuals | ~50 KB |
| `hourly_profile.json` | Typical daily production curve | ~5 KB |
| `hourly_data.json` | Last 60 days of hourly measurements | ~30 KB |

**✅ These files are automatically backed up by Home Assistant and survive updates.**

## Advanced Features

### Service Architecture (v5.0.0)

The integration uses enterprise-grade service management:

- **Service Manager:** Coordinates all services with health checks
- **Dependency Handler:** Ensures sensors are available before operations
- **Error Handler:** Categorizes errors and applies recovery strategies
- **Notification Service:** Rate-limited, multi-channel notifications

### ML Pipeline

Three-stage progression:
1. **Rule-Based (Days 1-7):** Uses weather factors and plant kWp
2. **Hybrid (Days 8-30):** Blends rules with learned patterns
3. **Full ML (Day 31+):** Fully adaptive with confidence weighting

### Forecast Strategies

Modular strategy pattern allows:
- `MLForecastStrategy`: Machine learning predictions
- `RuleBasedForecastStrategy`: Weather-based fallback
- Automatic fallback on low confidence or missing data
